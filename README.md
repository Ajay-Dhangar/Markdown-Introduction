## How to write in Markdown

### Unordered list

<ul>
   <li>item-1</li>
   <li>item-2</li>
</ul>

<hr />

### Write Table:

`Code`

```
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| cell 1    | cell 2    | cell 3    |
| cell 4    | cell 5    | cell 6    |
```

`Output`

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| cell 1    | cell 2    | cell 3    |
| cell 4    | cell 5    | cell 6    |

### other way

`Code`

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>A heading 1</th>
    <th>A heading 2</th>
    <th>A heading 3</th>
    <th>A heading 4</th>
    <th>A heading 5</th>
    <th>A heading 6</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
    <td>
      Something much longer that really goes into a lot of detail about
      something, so much so that the table formatting starts to look bad in GFM
      format.
    </td>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
    <td>
      Another cell with lots of text in it, that also really goes into a lot of
      detail about something, so much so that the table formatting starts to
      look bad in GFM format.
    </td>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

`Output`

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>A heading 1</th>
    <th>A heading 2</th>
    <th>A heading 3</th>
    <th>A heading 4</th>
    <th>A heading 5</th>
    <th>A heading 6</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
    <td>
      Something much longer that really goes into a lot of detail about
      something, so much so that the table formatting starts to look bad in GFM
      format.
    </td>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
    <td>
      Another cell with lots of text in it, that also really goes into a lot of
      detail about something, so much so that the table formatting starts to
      look bad in GFM format.
    </td>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
    <td>Something shortish</td>
